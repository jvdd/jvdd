### Hi there 👋


I like to solve problems with code 🖥️🤖💥. Among other things :)

## Skills

- **Programming**: Python, Rust, Java, SQL, ...
- **Data Science**: Data Analysis, Data Wrangling, Machine Learning, ...
- **Software Engineering**: Design, Development, Testing, ...
- **DevOps**: CI/CD, Git, Linux, ssh, ...

## Projects I (co)created

- [plotly-resampler](https://github.com/predict-idlab/plotly-resampler): add scalability to the [plotly.py](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) toolkit for time series visualization through efficient resampling in the backend.
- [tsflex](https://github.com/predict-idlab/tsflex): provide a flexible and efficient way to process & extract features from time series data.
- [powershap](https://github.com/predict-idlab/powershap): a [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) compatible feature selector using statistical hypothesis testing and power calculations on Shapley values.
- [argminmax](https://github.com/jvdd/argminmax): highly optimized implementation of argmin & argmax (in 1 function) using SIMD instructions and runtime CPU feature detection.
- [tsdownsample](https://github.com/predict-idlab/tsdownsample): extremely fast time series downsampling for visualization.
